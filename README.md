# PyQC

## About:
PyQC is a framework for creating and measuring Parameterised Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
in Python, by acting as a wrapper around the QuTIP library. A series of PQCs from the
literature have been implemented using the framework alongside various collated capacity
measures.

## Usage:
Copy the folder 'pyqc_lib' into your project folder and use
```
from pyqc_lib import pyqc
```
Check out <span style="font-family:Courier New;">hello\_world.py</span> or <span style="font-family:Courier New;">tests.py</span> for examples of the framework in action.

## Circuits:

## Capacity measures:
Capacity measures tell you how well an aspect of a PQC is performing, e.g entanglement measures the amount of entanglement generated by the circuit, expressibility describes how well an N qubit circuit explores the N qubit Hilbert space.

- Expressibility: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10876
- QFIM: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05074
- Effective Quantum Dimension: 	DOI:10.1103/prxquantum.2.040309
- RÃ©nyi Entropy of Magic: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12587
- GKP Magic: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13018
- Effective Hilbert Space - new measure based on finding the subspace that minimises a circuit's expressibility.

## Technical decisions:
- Python: de-facto scientific programming language, interoperability with QuTIP important.
- Object oriented: circuits being comprised of layers of gates with similar shared behaviours seemed a good fit.
- Designed to allow users to create PQCs more easily than writing every gate by hand in QuTIP or similar program.
